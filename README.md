SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

Description:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It involves preprocessing raw text data, extracting features using NLP techniques, and training multiple models to evaluate performance.

Key Contributions:

Cleaned and preprocessed the SMS dataset by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and eliminating stopwords.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify class distribution and key word patterns.

Applied feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Built and evaluated models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

Achieved high accuracy and precision in classifying spam messages.

Visualized results using confusion matrices and word clouds.
